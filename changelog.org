* v0.1.3
- *BREAKING*: change =echoResult= argument order to take =mp_result=
  as second argument instead of third and =xact= as third. Better
  matches typical usage.
- add =pretty= procedure that generates the string for =echoResult=
  with many different arguments to customize output. Can be called
  manually to use the string in different ways.
- add =mpfit/plotting= submodule to automatically generate a plot from
  a performed fit (depends on =ggplotnim=)
* v0.1.2
- allow to change configuration of =mpfit= calls via a custom
  =MpConfig= object
- fix type conversions to make code compile on ARC
